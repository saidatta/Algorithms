class Leaderboard {
    // Solution using Balanced Binary Search Tree
    // Time Complexity:
    // addScore, reset: O(logN)
    // top(K): O(K)
    // Space Complexityt: O(N)

    // frequency map, score -> frequency of players with that score.

    // type needs to be TreeMap and not just Map interface, since we
    // cannot just use any implementation of Map and need to use TreeMap
    // only as we are looking for Balanced BST (balanced binary search tree)
    //
    // this map basically keeps all the scores in descending order along
    // with the number of players that currently have that score
    //
    // we have this data structure entirely to optimize top(K) method, it has no other purpose.

        // the value associated with the score by 1 in the sortedScores map
        //
        // scenario #2: the player is already present in the leaderboard:
        // (1) update the score in the leaderboard
        // and (2) decrement the value associated with old score by 1
        // and increment the value associated with updated score by 1 in the sortedScores map
        //
        // from the above discussion a good and experienced coder would come up with
        // below concise and clean code.

        // of their score, since score is the key of the BST nodes.
