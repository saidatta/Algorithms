     * the maximum distance from the current jump. This is why totalCount represents the minimum number of jumps â€” it

     * Start at the first position.
     * For each position, jump to all the possible positions you can reach from that position.
     * Each time you jump to a new position, mark it as visited to ensure you don't revisit it.
