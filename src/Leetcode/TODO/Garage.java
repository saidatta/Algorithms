 * <p>
 * # There is a parking lot with only one empty spot. Given the initial state
 * # of the parking lot and the final state. Each step we are only allowed to
 * # move a car
 * # out of its place and move it into the empty spot.
 * # The goal is to find out the least movement needed to rearrange
 * # the parking lot from the initial state to the final state.
 * <p>
 * # Say the initial state is an array:
 * <p>
 * # [1,2,3,0,4],
 * # where 1,2,3,4 are different cars, and 0 is the empty spot.
 * <p>
 * # And the final state is
 * <p>
 * # [0,3,2,1,4].
 * # We can swap 1 with 0 in the initial array to get [0,2,3,1,4] and so on.
 * # Each step swap with 0 only.
