 * 3-4. Design a dictionary data structure in which search, insertion, and deletion can all be processed in O(1) time
 * in the worst case.You may assume the set elements are integers drawn from a finite set 1,2,..,n, and initialization
 * can take O(n) time.
 *
 * Solution - Since 1,2,...,n is finite, use a bit array to represent them.
